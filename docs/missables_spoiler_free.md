I replaced any potential plot reference with generic names. To keep you guessing, I also removed the type of rewards from completing a sidequest.

The name of the locations and playable characters are left intact as they are the core feature of the game. If you treat it as spoiler, that is on you.

__The third act will be ready approximately by end of February 2019 as I need to finish my first playthrough of the Definitive Edition. I have beaten the game on the Xbox 360 without a guide so I'm taking my time to ensure I do not miss out on any missables in this playthrough.__
